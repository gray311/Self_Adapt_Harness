"""Generated-tool gate/self-test utility.

Canonical reward-route runs call :func:`review_tool_code` with
``repair_fn=None, max_rounds=0`` *inside* ``validate_harness``.  That path is a
deterministic static gate plus local mock-context self-test and never changes
the bytes submitted by H1.

The optional ``repair_fn`` loop remains only for explicitly noncanonical legacy
experiments.  It returns a proposed repaired string to its caller; it never
mutates a candidate package and is not called by ``outer.propose`` or
``submit_harness``.

# Legacy repair-path anti-leak invariants (canonical runs never enter it):
#   1. repair_fn MUST be the SAME frozen served M0 endpoint the inner loop uses
#      — never a stronger external model. Capability parity is what keeps the
#      reviewer from injecting solution knowledge the executor doesn't have.
#   2. the repair prompt carries ONLY the code + gate errors — never the task
#      spec, evaluator, sample data, or scores.
#   3. a repair must be a LOCALIZED fix, not a rewrite: if the "fix" diverges
#      too far from the original it is rejected (fail-closed), so the reviewer
#      cannot smuggle in a new algorithm under the guise of a bug fix.
