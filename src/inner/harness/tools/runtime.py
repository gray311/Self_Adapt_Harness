"""Run-scoped bridge between the synchronous NexAU tools and the active task.

Mirrors Weave's ``harness/nexau/tools/runtime.py`` pattern: the harness sets the
active :class:`~inner.session.InnerSession` in a contextvar for the duration of
one agent run; the tool bindings and middleware resolve it via
:func:`get_session`. The contextvar itself lives in ``inner.session`` (the
single owner of session state); this module re-exports it so components import
it from the conventional ``inner.harness.tools.runtime`` location.
